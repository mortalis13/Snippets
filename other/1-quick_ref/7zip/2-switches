Command Line Switches
Syntax

<switch>::= <switch_symbol><switch_characters>[<option>]
<switch_symbol> ::= '/' | '-' 

On the command line, a switch consists of a switch specifier, either a dash (-) or a forward slash (/), followed by the name of the switch. Switch names cannot be abbreviated.

Some switches take an argument after the switch name. No spaces or tabs are allowed within a switch specification. Switch names are not case sensitive, but arguments can be case sensitive.

Switch can be used in any place in command line.

See also Command Line Syntax for more details about using the command line.
